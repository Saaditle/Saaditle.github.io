# Hi, I am Saad, I'm a builder for Roblox.

I've enjoyed making and creating games since I was 14, but I never had the opportunity to immerse myself for real until now, at the age of 17.


I work with low-poly builds and I'm constantly looking to improve.

I have no experience building for anyone else as of now, but I'm looking forward to getting started.

I currently have no examples to provide, but I will have some soon.
I love creating and building things, and I'm looking forward to continuing to grow.
